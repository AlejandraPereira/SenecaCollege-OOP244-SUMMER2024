/*During this workshop, I learned how to effectively manage classes, including defining and creating copy constructors 
and allocators, as well as implementing mechanisms to prevent unwanted copies in a class. In the process, I faced challenges with memory 
leaks and access errors early on, especially when implementing the [] operator, where it was important to properly handle array bounds to 
prevent illegal accesses. I also gained experience in overloading operators such as << and >> to facilitate printing and reading objects 
using ostream and istream, respectively. Additionally, I applied file input and output techniques using ifstream and ofstream, and using 
the C++ string class to efficiently handle variable-length data in these operations.*/
