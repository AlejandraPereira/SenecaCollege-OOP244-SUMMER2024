In this workshop, I was able to understand and learn how multiple versions of a function with the same name
but with different parameter lists can be implemented to handle various cases efficiently. This method, known as
function overloading, allows us to write more flexible and readable code by providing different ways to call a 
function depending on the parameters passed. I also learned about the importance of using dynamic memory properly, 
with the new[] keyword we can allocate a contiguous block of memory and by using delete[], we can free the allocated 
memory once it is no longer needed. Additionally, the use of bool data type in functions to return values of true or
false, which makes verification easier and conditions are set more clearly.
