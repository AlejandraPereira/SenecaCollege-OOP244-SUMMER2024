In Workshop #9: Derived Classes and Resources, I learned important skills about creating 
and managing classes in C++. This workshop focused on using derived classes to build on 
existing classes, making it easier to extend and reuse code. I practiced implementing the 
Rule of Three, which means defining how to copy, assign, and delete objects to handle dynamic 
memory properly. This rule helps prevent memory leaks and other issues by ensuring that resources 
are managed correctly. I also learned how to overload operators, which allows me to change how classes 
behave with common operations like addition or printing. Managing memory correctly is key to avoiding 
problems like resource leaks and crashes. Overall, this workshop helped me get better at designing classes 
and managing resources in C++, which will be useful for creating more reliable and efficient code in future projects.
