For this workshop, I learned how to make function declarations and how to declare an empty state
when a value is not valid. Additionally, I practiced formatting styles using width() and alignment
with control flags to create the necessary spaces for the table to be created correctly. Using format 
conversions was a bit challenging for me, especially when setting the field width. At first, I was not 
quite sure of the correct order to write them in to get the desired result. So, I experimented with different 
ways and orders until I achieved the result I was looking for.
