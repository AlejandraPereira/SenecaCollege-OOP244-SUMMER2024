In this workshop I learned that the constructor is a special method of a class that is called 
automatically when an instance of the class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the members
of the class and prepare it for use. Constructors can be default, parameterless, or parameterized.
On the other hand, a destructor is also a special method that is invoked when an object is about to be destroyed, 
either because it has gone out of scope or because delete has been explicitly called on a pointer pointing to it.
Destructors are used to free allocated resources, such as memory or files, and ensure proper cleanup of objects. 
In C++, we define a destructor with the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~). For this assignment we
also learned about that the reference to the current object in C++ is made using the 'this' pointer, which is used 
within the class's methods to access its own members and functions.
