During this workshop, I learned how to organize a program into separate modules, compile each module individually, 
and then link them together to create an executable program. The process involved breaking down the shopping list program 
into essential components: the main application, file management, shopping list , shoppingRec file, and utility functions. 
In this setup, the header files (.h) contain the function prototypes and structure definitions, while the implementation files (.cpp) contain 
the actual code. This organization ensures that the code is more manageable and reusable. Compilation safeguards, using #ifndef, #define, 
and #endif, prevent errors from multiple inclusions of the same header file by allowing code to proceed only if the name is not defined.
If the name is already defined, the check fails and the header is not included again. Encapsulating the code within the seneca
namespace avoids name conflicts. Compiling each module separately and then linking them together teaches effective dependency management.
