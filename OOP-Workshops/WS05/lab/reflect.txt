In this workshop, I learned how to design a C++ class with different states (invalid, new, valid) and 
how to handle state transitions. Additionally, I implemented type conversion operators to convert account 
objects to bool, int, and double, and unary operators like ~ to check if an account is new. I also learned
about overloading binary operators (=, +=, -=) to manage allocations and balance adjustments, and used flow 
operators (<<, >>) to facilitate fund transfers between accounts. For this workshop I also wrote helper 
functions to perform operations on class instances without altering them.
